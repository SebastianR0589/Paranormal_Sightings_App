# Sebastian Riedel Portfolio
# Paranormal Sighting App

This project is a small server-side application built with Node.js to practice handling user input, managing in-memory data, and structuring a simple backend.

The application allows users to submit reports of paranormal sightings, which are then displayed in a list. The focus is on backend logic, routing, and data management rather than frontend design.
